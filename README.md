# International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) v4.0 notes
In this repository, you can find my personal notes and definitions for the Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) exam v4.0. The syllabus of the certification basically covers everything about testing fundamentals from basic definitions to applying them to practice, so I made my own "quick glance" file for studying.

Please note that this repository's information is based on **v4.0** syllabus &rarr; it can and most likely will alter in the future - these materials most likely will become obsolete over time. I still hope these notes offer some assistance - good luck with the exam!
